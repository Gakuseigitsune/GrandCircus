        Welcome visitor! Not much to post here on blogging yet,
        but you can be sure that eventually this spot will be
        updated with plenty of blogging content, likely linked to social media!

        Development on a retro styled windows console based RPG is ongoing.
        It'll be fully coded in C# and include colors and sound!
        Eventually it might even be ported over into Untiy some full on 2D graphics.

        I'm based out of Romulus, MI.
        It's a small town to the west of Detroit that also happens to contain the major airport here (DTW).
        It's a quiet town (aside from the occasional train passthough) that has the
        perfect blend of rural and suburban, (map coming soon!)
